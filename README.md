# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
The CEO of PyBer has requested an analysis on their rideshare data.  For this analysis we were asked to create a multiple-line graph showing weekly fares for each city type.

The calculations required included:
1. Total Ride Count
2. Total Driver Count
3. Total Fares
4. Average Fare per Ride
5. Average Fare per Driver

These metrics were summarized by city type to understand the differences in the business and help guide future decisions at Pyber.

## Resources
- Data source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.11, Jupyter notebook 6.4.6
